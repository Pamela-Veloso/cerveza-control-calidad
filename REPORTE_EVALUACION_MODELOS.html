            <h3>🎯 Problema Resuelto</h3>
            <p><strong>"¿Cuánto alcohol tendrá mi cerveza?"</strong></p>
          <p>
    El modelo predice el contenido de alcohol (ABV) utilizando parámetros iniciales como la densidad
    (OG), pH e IBU. Aunque el ABV real solo se confirma al finalizar la fermentación, la predicción
    temprana permite anticipar el comportamiento del lote, detectar desviaciones potenciales y tomar
    decisiones correctivas antes de completar el proceso.

            <p>Ideal para recetas experimentales, este modelo proporciona no solo la clasificación 
            más probable, sino también la <strong>distribución completa de probabilidades</strong> 
            para cada estilo, ayudando a los cerveceros a entender qué tan cerca está su
